#### WHY DID WE CHOOSE THIS?
- easy to use for people
- admin can easily input data
- ppl more scared since not just big blocks of hotspots, but actual places with stuff
- plus we know what households have covid so we don't go there
---
#### PROBLEMS
- it's a website, not app, so less easy to carry around - reason is bc app takes up storage in phone, drains battery
- ppl feel no privacy - for the greater good guysss like hello - also just a check to ensure ppl are quarantining if positive
- kind of shaming like if someone in a covid household goes out, no friends will wanna go so safety
