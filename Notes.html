<p>
    WHY DID WE CHOOSE THIS? <br>
    -easy to use for people<br>
    -admin can easily input data<br>
    -ppl more scared since not just big blocks of hotspots, but actual places with stuff<br>
    -plus we know what households have covid so we don't go there<br>
    <br>
    PROBLEMS<br>
    -it's a website, not app, so less easy to carry around - reason is bc app takes up storage in phone, drains battery<br>
    -ppl feel no privacy - for the greater good guysss like hello - also just a check to ensure ppl are quarantining
    if positive <br>
    - kind of shaming like if someone in a covid household goes out, no friends will wanna go so safety <br>
